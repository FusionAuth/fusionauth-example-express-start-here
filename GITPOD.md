# Example Get Started Application in GitPod

This repo holds an example Express.js application that uses FusionAuth as the identity provider. 
This application will use an OAuth Authorization Code Grant workflow to log a user in and 
get them access and refresh tokens.

## Pulling Docker Containers

The system is creating a fusionauth server, along with the backend containers needed to run it.  When it is done you will have a login for the system.

Login to the server with 'admin@example.com' and password 'password' to verify that the installation has worked.  Once there, you can move on to the Delegate step.
